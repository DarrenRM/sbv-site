            <p>
              We believe that DAOs will power the future of work. Through the
              MetaCartel network, we assembled a fellowship of the best
              builders, designers and hustlers in the space in order to make
              this future a reality. By sharing resources, branding and
              collaboration tools, we can create positive-sum value for the
              Ethereum ecosystem in a way that has never been possible before
              the advent of DAOs.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe in Web3 and are here to build it, use it, and propogate
              it. The profits from our work will be used to fund development of
              open source tooling and public goods. We will share the learnings
              from our experiments and open source our processes for the
              community to learn and build from.

          We believe workers should be self-sovereign and able to work when,
          where and how they want, as long as they create high value output.
